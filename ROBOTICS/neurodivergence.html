    <p> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) a neuro-developmental condition that affects social communication and sensory processing
    There are different types of autism:
    Level 1 autism: These people need less support and can do somethings in their own.
    <br>
    Level 2 autism: These people need substantial support but can do most things on their own.
    <br>
    Level 3 autism: These people need alot of support and can't do most things on their own and need help on social interactions and others.
    <br>
    Non-verbal autism - This type of autism is more common in low-functionning autism, this type of autism causes people to only
     say certain words or phrases or not even talk at all level 3 autism because they struggle with delayed speech development.
     <br>
    Hyper-verbal autism - This type of autism allows people to talk normally or talk alot
    <br>
    here are the symptoms of autism although they can vary from person to person:
    <br>
    Bad social communication - People with autism have trouble with social interactions and can sometimes:
    Not make eye contact
    <br>
    not want to engage in physical touch (E.G. Hugs,kisses etc)
    <br>
    have bad facial recognition and might not tell if happy or sad
<br>
    Sensory issues - mostly autistic people can have sensory issues what this means is that some textures,smells,tastes and others can be overwhelming to an autistic person, for example:
    Olfactory: Some odors might lead to sensory overload (where an autistic person gets overwhelmed due to some factors)
     like the smell of perfumes or antibiotics that you don't know why you should take even though there are other things to help you with your sickness trust me iv'e been there.
     <br>
    Sensory seeking: Sometimes people who have autism can wear certain clothes or eat certain things because they like it.
    <br>
    stimming: Let's say you see someone carrying around a plushie but they are way too old too have it and when you take it away from them they start worrying or they could be doing something totally different 
    and they could be making noises or flapping their arms because it calms them down. This is stimming, a way to calm down when having a meltdown or shutdown, it can also be utilized for emotional control.
    <br>
    Meltdown: When overstimulation occurs sometimes people with autism can experience a variety of emotions like sadness, irratibility and anger, this could also happen when masking has taken place for too long.
    Shutdown: Just like a meltdown, but anger would occur more than other emotions and depression could take place.
    <br>
    
    <br>
    Masking - If you see someone having a good time but when they leave their face is different and so is their body langauge
     we autistics do that to fit in, I have something called respect masking i need to make sure everyone else is okay so they don't hate me.
     <br>
     Literal thinking - "The ball is in your court" or "The apple doesn't fall far" neurotypicals can understand that these are idioms if you ask me, you should probably just say the actual meaning
    we don't think like neurotypicals do so if you said this to me i would start laughing or go insane this is because we process differently and we can't understand when you are being sarcastic, not every autistic knows what you're talking about.
     <br>
     Delayed speech development - Sometimes we can take long to answer or we can't find words because we talk too fast delayed speech development isn't just taking forever to speak sometimes we have different ways of processing.
     <br>
     echolaia: Let's say you are talking to someone but every word you say is repeated we aren't trying to be copycats that's just how we process without really knowing the actual meaning.
     <br>
     <h4>Problems with understanding autism:</h4>
     <p> Abelism: there are some people in the world that don't properly understand or respect the autism spectrum      
      In conclusion: Autism spectrum disorder is a disorder in which an individual struggles with social communication and sensory issues, it is not a disability it's a gift, every austistic is different and not all of them are math savants or quirky, they even maybe both, autism is different for everyone and everyone should be given a chance to be accepeted.
